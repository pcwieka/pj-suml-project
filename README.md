# PJ SUML Project

## How to install dependencies

For detailed information about the Conda environment setup, see the [Conda environment documentation](docs/conda_environment.md).

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to run Kedro Viz

Run:

```
kedro viz
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
pytest
```

You can configure the coverage threshold in your project's `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.coverage.report]` section.


## Project dependencies

To see and update the dependency requirements for your project see [Conda environment documentation](docs/conda_environment.md).

[Further information about project dependencies](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/kedro_project_setup/dependencies.html#project-specific-dependencies)

## Docker

See the [Makefile](Makefile) in the root of the project.

Run `make all` to build and start all containers.

Alternatively you can execute the commands one by one:

```
make build
make up
```

Then run kedro training pipelines:

```
make kedro-run
```

Use [API](api/README.md) to use the model for predictions.

Run `make down` to remove all the containers after you are done.


## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `context`, 'session', `catalog`, and `pipelines`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can use tools like [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout). For example, you can add a hook in `.git/config` with `nbstripout --install`. This will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.
